                    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m conducting a short research study to understand how college students organize their time, manage classes, and stay focused â€” especially when juggling multiple responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>This isnâ€™t about testing or diagnosing ADHD. Iâ€™m interested in your real experiences â€” whatâ€™s hard, what helps, and what you wish existed.</p>
                    <p>There are no right or wrong answers â€” just honest ones. Your input will help us understand how to better support students like you.</p>
                    <p>It takes about 10â€“12 minutes, and all responses are confidential and anonymous.</p>
